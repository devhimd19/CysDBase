# CysDBase
Database collection of cysteine Post-Translational Modifications namely Disulphide, S-glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation, S-sulphenylation, S-palmitoylation, Thioether and Metal-binding.First database to store the information of Thioether, S-sulphenylation and across various metals that exhibits Metal-binding. 

# Background 
Cysteine thiol undergoes various post-translational modifications that contribute to a large number of biochemical, physiological, and cellular processes. Consolidated information about these modifications would be a valued addition to the scientific community for ready reference. A few published datasets are available on specific cysteine modifications; those are less diverse in nature. The aim of this work is to develop a large repository of multiple cysteine post-translational modifications from all the available species encompassing the maximum number of features.

# Main findings 
This CysDBase database reports seven cysteine modifications from 1,14,56,639 cysteine extracted from proteins belonging to various taxa that belongs to Virus, Eukaryote, Bacteria and Archaea. These seven modifications are – Disulphide, Metal-binding, S-sulphenylation, Thioether, S-glutathionylation, S-palmitoylation and S-nitrosylation. Corresponding to each cysteine residue, the following features are reported in the database – post-translational modifications, protein sequences (within window size, 7), cellular location, pathway, PubMed ID, PDB_ID, buried fraction and protein microenvironment (rHpy). To note, each residue may have multiple modifications. Some features may not be returned for certain entries, due to the unavailability of the experimental data; for example, if PDB ID is not available buried fraction and protein microenvironment will not be reported. This database, for the first time, reports Thioether, S-sulphenylation and across various metals that exhibits Metal-binding of cysteine residue.

# Main advances
- CysDBase database is a repository of seven post-translational modifications from 1,14,56,639 cysteine residues extracted from various proteins present in various taxa that belongs to Virus, Eukaryote, Bacteria and Archaea. The features corresponding to each cysteine entry are post-translational modification, protein sequence (within a given window size), location, pathway, PubMed ID, PDB ID, buried fraction, and protein microenvironment (subject to availability of the experimental data).
- For the first time the database reports the protein microenvironments for various cysteine post-translational modifications.
- This is the first database reporting Thioether, S-sulphenylation and across various metal that exhibits Metal-binding.

# Biological Relevance
Post-translational modifications of cysteine residues were scattered throughout the literature. A comprehensive report is presented here. The search results produce diverse features such as the location of the modifications, pathways, protein microenvironment, etc., which can be applied to address various biological questions.

# Significance
CysDBase curates the experimentally determined cysteine modifications from the maximum number of species and reports the highest number of features, with search queries. The database reports the protein microenvironment feature, for the first time.

# Conclusion
CysDBase database is a comprehensive repository of seven cysteine post-translational modifications and their related features, reporting for the maximum number of species and diverse features.
